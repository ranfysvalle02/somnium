Somnium (2025) is a psychological horror and sci-fi thriller about a young woman named Gemma who moves to Los Angeles to pursue her dream of becoming an actress after a painful breakup. Struggling to make ends meet, she takes a night job at a mysterious sleep clinic called Somnium.

The clinic, founded by a renowned sports psychologist, specializes in "reprogramming" the minds of its patients through "designer dreams" to help them achieve their goals. As Gemma works the overnight shift, watching over the sleeping patients, she starts to notice strange and unsettling things. Her own nightmares about her ex-boyfriend and her past begin to bleed into her reality, and she glimpses a menacing, contorted figure lurking in the shadows.

The film blurs the line between reality and hallucination, leading Gemma and the audience to question what is real. The plot also touches on the pressures of chasing Hollywood dreams and the idea of manufactured versus authentic ambition. It culminates in a trippy, ambiguous final act that forces Gemma to confront her fears in a world where dreams can become a terrifying reality.
